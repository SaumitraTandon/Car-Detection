# Car Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script that uses the OpenCV library to detect cars in an image using a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:
## Usage

1. Place your image(s) in the `images` directory.

2. Update the file path in the script to point to your image(s).

3. Run the script:
The script will process the specified image(s) and display the result with detected cars highlighted by green rectangles.
